            <p>Hello! I'm Zamagcina Ngeyane, a dedicated software engineering student with a strong passion for crafting innovative, user-centric solutions. With expertise in Python, Java, JavaScript, and Test Automation frameworks such as JUnit, NUnit, and PyTest, I aim to create high-quality, scalable software.</p>
            <p>Currently pursuing my qualification at WeThinkCode_, I thrive on challenging projects that push my technical abilities and foster continuous learning. I focus on both front-end and back-end development, with a particular interest in automation and quality assurance.</p>
            <p>When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, reading, or learning about new technologies and industry trends. My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer who contributes to impactful, real-world projects.</p>
