            <p>Hello there! I'm Zamagcina Ngeyane, a passionate software engineering student with a knack for building innovative solutions using Python, HTML&CSS, Java, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I am knowledgeable in Test Automation, utilizing various testing frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, and PyTest to ensure the reliability and functionality of software applications.</p>
            <p>Currently pursuing my qualification in software engineering at WeThinkCode_, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and enhance my skills. I'm actively involved in projects both inside and outside of the classroom, always eager to learn and grow as a developer.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, reading a good book, or tinkering with new gadgets. I believe in the power of lifelong learning and am excited to see where this journey takes me next.</p>
